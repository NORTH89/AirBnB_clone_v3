## Requirements

## Python Scripts

Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.**doc**)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").my_function.**doc**)' and python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.my_function.**doc**)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Python Unit Tests

Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
You have to use the `unittest` module
All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
Your file organization in the `tests` folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
